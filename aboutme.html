          <h3 class="text-muted">I am a high school student in Silicon Valley who is passionate about both computer science and art. I first started drawing when I was 5 years old and coding when I was 14 years old. Art and computer science may not seem to have any correlation, but finding ways to integrate them together has allowed me to get the best of both worlds.</h3>

          <p class="lead">Everyone starts somewhere, and I got my start at the heart of art creation in Silicon Valley. My parents, who are both immigrants from China, allowed me to try out several extracurricular activites at a young age. While art was not something either of them had tried before, they thought my quiet and calm personality would fit perfectly with drawing. They sent me to a Chinese art teacher, where I first learned how to sketch, color with markers and colored pencils, and paint with watercolor. </p>
          <h3 class="lead"> As I grew, my art style evidently matured and I started to seriously focus on a few art mediums. My biggest focus in middle school was pencil sketching, and at the start of high school I turned towards acrylic painting. It was also in high school that I began to test out unconventional mediums (such as thread, spray paint, etc.) and explore complex topics about the world.</h3>
